# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

## About me
I am currently a student at [ChasAcademy](https://chasacademy.se/program/fullstackutvecklare-opensource) to become a Fullstack Developer!  
Before that I worked in retail for 10+ years, but felt I needed a change.  

I'm a very curios being and always what to understand the how and the why and always looking for a way to optimize. With that I also love to solve problems, so I figured this was a natural step for me!
