# 👋 Welcome!

## About me

- 🌱 I’m currently exploring the world of backend.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've had 26 
:blush:

I am currently a student at [ChasAcademy](https://chasacademy.se/program/fullstackutvecklare-opensource), in the midst of my journey to becoming a fullstack developer, and I’m absolutely hyped to master coding and bring ideas to life!  
I have over a decade of experience in retail, where I developed an understanding of human behavior and gained extensive expertise in usability and customer interaction.  

I'm a very curious being and always wants to understand the how and the why. Always looking for a way to optimize, with that said, I also love to solve problems, so I figured this was a natural step for me!
